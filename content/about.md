Hi, I’m a 1992-born software engineer with a deep passion for photography.

While I spend my days crafting code and building digital solutions,
photography is my creative outlet — a way to slow down and observe the world from a different perspective.

From spontaneous street scenes to serene landscapes, I love framing the beauty I see around me.
